The Shorty app offers a service to store, manage and use a collection of shortened links pointing to different resources in the web. The features are a combination of a centralized bookmarks collection, a URL shortener and a basic access control.

A new entry, a Shorty, can be created either manually by entering a URL ("New shorty") or by simply clicking the "Shortlet" whenever you come over a page you want to share. This "Shortlet" is something like a Bookmarklet, a script based bookmark meant to be stored inside the bookmark area of your web browser. When clicked, the page currently open in the browser will be added to your collection of Shortys, including a practical shortened URL.

Each Shorty contains a source and a target URL. The source URL can be used to be posted in forums, sent inside an email message or whatever. It is typically much shorter than the target URL, a full blown web URL, though this depends a little on which shortening service you want to use as a "backend". Basic access control is implemented to control the access of Shortys posted to forums or sent per email, but not on a per user or per group base. Existing Shortys can be blocked for usage, set to expire on a certain date and obviously can be removed permanently again.
